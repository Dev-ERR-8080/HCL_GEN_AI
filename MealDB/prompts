OPtimized prompt by AI itself:
Prompt:
I have a JavaScript snippet that fetches meal data from the TheMealDB API. I need to complete this script to fulfill the following requirements:

Iteration: Iterate through all letters 'a' through 'z' to fetch all available meals.

Logic: For every meal fetched, calculate the number of ingredients. Ingredients are stored in keys strIngredient1 through strIngredient20. An ingredient is only valid if it is not an empty string and not null.

Goal: Identify the single dish across all letters that has the minimum number of ingredients.

Asynchronous Handling: Ensure the code handles the multiple asynchronous fetch calls correctly (e.g., using Promise.all or async/await) so the final result is logged only after all data is processed.

Output: Log the name of the dish and its ingredient count to the console.
